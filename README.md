Basic Linear classification problem to get you started for the course. You will use Logistic Regression to diagnose Cancer. You will apply linear methods with L1 and L2 regularization and understand what effects they have on your regression results. You also will epxeriment with hyperparameter optimization to tune your model with cross-validation.
